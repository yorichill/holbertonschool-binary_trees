# C - Binary Trees

Project completed in a team of two: **Thélyaan Dufrénoy** & **Thomas Haenel**

## 📘 Description

This project focuses on implementing various functions to manipulate **binary trees** in the C programming language.  
It covers fundamental concepts such as:

- What a binary tree is
- The difference between a Binary Tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST)
- The possible time complexity improvements compared to linked lists
- Definitions of **depth**, **height**, and **size** of a binary tree
- Different traversal methods: *preorder*, *inorder*, *postorder*, *level-order*
- Definitions of **complete**, **full**, **perfect**, and **balanced** binary trees

## 🛠️ Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compilation will be done on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** with:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

- All your files must end with a new line
- A **README.md** file at the root of the project is mandatory
- Your code must follow the **Betty coding style**  
(checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)
- **Global variables are forbidden**
- No more than **5 functions per file**
- You are allowed to use the **standard library**
- Example `main.c` files may be shown in the tasks, but must **not** be pushed to the repository  
(we will use our own `main.c` files for testing)
- All function prototypes must be declared in the header file **binary_trees.h**
- All header files must have proper *include guards*

## 🔐 GitHub Rules

- There must be **one GitHub repository per group**.
- If you clone/fork a repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk receiving a **0% grade**.
